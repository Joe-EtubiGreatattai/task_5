Schema Design: We created a schema using Mongoose for managing a list of books with fields like title, author, publishedYear, genre, and copiesSold.
Integration with MongoDB: We connected the API to MongoDB, allowing us to fetch, insert, update, and delete data from the database.
Sample Queries: Both in Mongoose and MongoDB shell, we wrote queries to fetch books and perform operations.
With this setup, you can interact with a NoSQL database like MongoDB in a Node.js project, using Mongoose for easy schema definition and queries.
